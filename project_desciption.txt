    I want to use python [and whatever I need for frontend] to make a journaling app. 

Reasoning...
    When I was searching for a mobile app, I had a specific vision in mind. A simple app, locally 
    hosted (with export capabilities). 

Design 
#Simple, Lightweight, 
    The user enters the app by inputting a PIN or password. 
    The app scrolls down to the most recent entry. 
    The user clicks on the new page and can begin typing right away.
    Or the user can scroll up and see past entries.
    When starting a new entry, common font can be chosen. 
        Text size, bold, italic, etc can be chosen.
